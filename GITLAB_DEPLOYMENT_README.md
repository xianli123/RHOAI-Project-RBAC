# GitLab Pages Deployment (gitlab-pages branch)

This project has been configured for GitLab Pages deployment using a dedicated 'gitlab-pages' branch to keep the main branch clean.

## Your Site Information
- **GitLab Pages URL**: Will be generated by GitLab after deployment
- **Repository**: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/uxd/apollo/patternfly-seed.git
- **Build Directory**: dist
- **Deployment Branch**: gitlab-pages

## What Was Done
1. Created `.gitlab-ci.yml` for automated deployment from 'gitlab-pages' branch
2. Configured build process for GitLab Pages  
3. Auto-detected build output directory: `dist`
4. Set up GitLab runner compatibility

## Deployment Workflow
This setup uses a dedicated 'gitlab-pages' branch for deployments:
- **main branch**: Keep clean for development work
- **gitlab-pages branch**: Used exclusively for triggering deployments

## Next Steps
1. Add GitLab as a remote repository
2. Create and switch to the 'gitlab-pages' branch
3. Push your code to the 'gitlab-pages' branch
4. Check Deploy → Pages for your live URL

## Commands to Deploy
```bash
# Add GitLab as remote (if not already added)
git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/uxd/apollo/patternfly-seed.git

# Commit the changes to current branch
git add .
git commit -m "Configure GitLab Pages deployment"

# Create and switch to gitlab-pages branch
git checkout -b gitlab-pages

# Push to GitLab gitlab-pages branch
git push gitlab gitlab-pages
```

## Future Deployments
When you want to deploy updates:
```bash
# From your main/development branch, merge changes to gitlab-pages branch
git checkout gitlab-pages
git merge main --no-edit
git push gitlab gitlab-pages
```

## Accessing Your Site
After pushing and pipeline completion:
1. Go to your GitLab project
2. **Deploy** → **Pages** (in left sidebar)
3. Your unique GitLab Pages URL will be displayed there

## Benefits of This Approach
- ✅ Keeps your main branch clean and focused on development
- ✅ Separates deployment concerns from main development workflow
- ✅ Easy to manage what gets deployed vs. what's in development
- ✅ Can have different configurations for deployment vs. development

## Troubleshooting
- Check the CI/CD pipeline in GitLab (look for "Pipelines" in the left sidebar)
- Ensure you're pushing to the 'gitlab-pages' branch (not main)
- Check GitLab Pages settings (look for "Pages" under "Settings" or "Deploy")
- Verify your build outputs to the `dist` directory
